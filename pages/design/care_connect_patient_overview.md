## Patient Profile ##

The patient profile is used by the Data Diagnostic Service to capture the following patient details for use within the service:

- Patients NHS Number (ID)
- Patient Name
- Primary address
- Date of Birth
- Patients Gender

Other elements found within the Care Connect Patient Profile are not required as part of this phase of the implementation, but may be used in a future release.
